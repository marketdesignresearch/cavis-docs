# About

CAVis was developed at the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/) in collaboration with [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/).

CAVis is an open-source web application, published under the GNU Affero license (Contributions are welcome!).
The source code of all components is [published](https://github.com/marketdesignresearch/) on GitHub.

Notable dependencies (each also developed and open-sourced by us) that enable this visualization are:

- [Mechanism Library](https://github.com/marketdesignresearch/mechlib/): A java library that provides the core concepts for several kinds of market mechanisms
- [SATS](http://spectrumauctions.org/): A "Spectrum Auction Test Suite" that provides the models and Winner Determination Problems of several spectrum auction domains

### Found a bug?

Sorry for that. We'd like to improve the tool, so please report it as detailed as possible (ideally, such that we can reproduce it) on [GitHub](https://github.com/marketdesignresearch/cavis-docs/issues/new).
